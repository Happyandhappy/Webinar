# webinar

The purpose of this project is to build a landing page for a webinar and a checkout page for users that purchase. This is a template that can be easily changed and I am using the code in the folder '05-rotating-text' for the landing page. The form uses PHP but I would like to build a flask backend and then use javascript for submitting the form so that we do not have to do a page refresh.

We will also need to implement the themes checkout form with the Stripe API.
